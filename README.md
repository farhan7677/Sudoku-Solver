# Sudoku Solver

A Python-based Sudoku solver with a graphical interface built using Pygame. This project features an interactive Sudoku board that lets users play and watch the solver in action using a backtracking algorithm. Ideal for exploring algorithmic problem-solving, game development, and Python coding with Pygame.

## Features

- **Sudoku Puzzle Generation**: Creates a random, partially filled 9x9 Sudoku board for the user to solve.
- **Backtracking Algorithm**: Efficiently finds solutions to any valid Sudoku puzzle.
- **Interactive GUI**: Allows user interaction, displays solution steps in real-time, and highlights correct/incorrect moves.
- **Timer and Strike Counter**: Keeps track of playtime and strikes for incorrect attempts.

## Installation

1. Ensure Python 3 and Pygame are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

2. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd sudoku-solver
   ```

3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Use

- **Number Input**: Use keys 1-9 to insert numbers in selected cells.
- **Space Key**: Solve the puzzle automatically.
- **Delete Key**: Clear the selected cell.

## Future Improvements

- Customizable difficulty levels
- Enhanced user interface and controls
- Additional solving algorithms
